# Pre-work - Tipo 

Tipo is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: Burak Firik

Time spent: 8 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [X] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [X] UI animations
* [X] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [X] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [X] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] Spent time analyzing the usability, and behavior of the app by asking users to give feedback
on the user interface. Iterated to ensure users love the app.
- [X] No storybord is used, I did it programmatically to display advanced knowledge of iOS
- [X] All the UI Elements are added using programatic autolayout constraints
- [X] Interface is beautifully displayed for all the iOS devices with autolayout constraints

## Notes

It was challenging to adjust all the UI elements using autolayout constraints, since I did not use the storyboard at all all the UI elements were set programatically, and ensured they work on 
    other iOS devices, which I manually tested.
